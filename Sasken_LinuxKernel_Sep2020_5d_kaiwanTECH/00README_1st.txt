Dear Participant,

Welcome to the kaiwanTECH training programme!

********************** PLEASE NOTE CAREFULLY ********************************

1. The instructor will provide you with all required content for the training
session. This will include:
1.1 The courseware PDF documents, and
1.2 The (reference/sample) source code.
1.3 A custom Linux VM (Virtual Machine, or guest) to run in! (Ubuntu-based)


2. These programs are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Several (well, some) of the programs/drivers are still undergoing modifications 
and/or enhancements and must therefore be considered to be incomplete.


3. Each participant will receive the above-mentioned PDFs and source code,
along with a quite customized and tuned Virtual Machine (that we brand as
'Seawolf'). It should contain all required packages and dependencies, making
your code experience easier. A lot of useful utilities are packed in too
(for example, see the ~/kaiwanTECH/usefulsnips directory in the Seawolf VM).


4. Legal, in brief:
Code is release under the terms of the MIT License.
Courseware PDF documents are considered propriietary and are not to be shared.


---------------------------------------
Installing the 'Seawolf Dev' VM
---------------------------------------
Very simple:
a) extract the content of the (large) 7zip file provided
b) ensure VirtualBox is installed on your host system
c) to open the VM in VirtualBox, just double-click on the
'Seawolf_Dev_<ver>.vbox' VBox configuration file. The VM
should open in VirtualBox
[do Not create a new VM]
d) Highlight the Seawolf Dev VM in VirtualBox and click on the VirtualBox
'Start' button

*** TIP / V IMP ***
Ensure that Virtualization Extension (VT-x) support is enabled in
your system BIOS!

In case you face any issues, pl read the short "Seawolf Dev VM - Troubleshooting
Tips" PDF document provided.


4. To be completely safe, it's *highly* recommended you back up your system
before running this code - obviously, especially kernel modules and drivers 
(see point 2 above ;-)

Running the code on an isolated Virtual Machine (VM) - one which does not
contain any important data - is recommended.


5. Licensing:
In a nutshell, the *source code* provided is licensed under the MIT License, 
keeping it simple and reusable with attribution. (IOW, you can certainly use 
the source code provided here; you must attribute the original source).
VERY IMPORTANT :: 
Before using this source(s) in your project(s), you *MUST* check with your 
organization's legal staff that it is appropriate to do so.

The courseware PDFs are *not* under the MIT License, they are to be kept
confidential, non-distributable without explicit written consent, for your
private internal study use only.


6. For futher info/program code etc please look up the URLs provided in 
your courseware.

*******************************************************************************

Hope this helps! As is often said with regard to Linux, 
"Above all, have fun!"

Warm Regards,
And all the very best,
Kaiwan.
