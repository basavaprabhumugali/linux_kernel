Hello All,

-------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS to Participants
-------------------------------------------
You will be provided with a custom Linux VM, to download via a URL.
Copy it to your host system.
The custom VM contains all - and more - required course materials, source code,
tools, apps, useful utils, etc.

Each participant will download and install a customized and tuned Virtual
Machine (that we brand as 'Seawolf'). It should contain all required packages
and dependencies, making your code experience easier. A lot of useful
utilities, packages, toolchains and small projects are packed in too
(for example, see the ~/kaiwanTECH/usefulsnips directory in the Seawolf VM).


---------------------------------------
Installing the 'Seawolf Dev' VM
---------------------------------------
Very simple:
a) extract the content of the (large) 7zip file in the download
b) ensure VirtualBox is installed on your host system
c) to open the VM in VirtualBox, just double-click on the
'Seawolf_Dev_<ver>.vbox' VBox configuration file. The VM
should open in VirtualBox
d) Highlight the Seawolf Dev VM in VirtualBox and click on the 'Start' button.


*** TIP / V IMP ***
Pl Ensure that Virtualization Extension (VT-x) support is enabled in your
system BIOS!


In case you face issues, please read the short "Seawolf Dev VM - Troubleshooting Tips"
